A short C++ program of the terminal word game from the the video game Fallout.

NOTES:

-Probably doesn't work on anything but Windows.
-Make sure pdcurses.dll and the WordFiles folder are kept in the same directory as FalloutWordGame.exe
-The game randomly selects 13 words and 1 answer, so it could be that in some rounds it is impossible to win. I have rarely found this to be the case. I'll probably sort this out one day. Probably.
-The potential words were copied from the internet and are numerous (in the 100000s), so it could be that some contained words are offensive. Sorry about that.
-If you want to compile this yourself, make sure you include the pdcurses library (pdcurses.lib) when compiling.
