A short C++ program of the terminal word game from the the video game Fallout.

NOTES:

-Probably doesn't work on anything but Windows.
-Make sure pdcurses.dll and the WordFiles folder are kept in the same directory as FalloutWordGame.exe
-The game randomly selects 13 words and 1 answer, so it could be that in some rounds it is impossible to win. I have rarely found this to be the case.
-If you want to compile this yourself, make sure you include the pdcurses library (pdcurses.lib) when compiling.
